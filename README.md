# DarkDmg
DarkDmg is a damage calc for Darkest Dungeon.

DarkDmg's function is to show a Hero's damage output across 4 skills at every +5% DMG breakpoint from trinkets/quirks. It also shows KO percentage with the option of including an enemy's PROT in the calculation.

Either the Embark button or pressing Enter in a textbox starts the calculation.

Special thanks to PhilosophicalHobbit from the Darkest Dungeon subreddit for correction on the game's damage formula.
