# DarkDmg
DarkDmg is a damage calc for Darkest Dungeon. Darkest Dungeon always rounds up player damage. It happens after a skill's modifier (like Point Blank Shot +50%) then again after trinkets/quirks. It can therefore be cumbersome when deciding which damage trinkets to use because a trinket slot could be wasted if damage rounds up to the same number anyway.
