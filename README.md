# DarkDmg
DarkDmg is a damage calc for Darkest Dungeon. 

Darkest Dungeon always rounds up player damage. It happens after a skill's modifier (like Point Blank Shot +50%) then again after trinket/quirk boosts. It can sometimes be difficult to decide which damage trinkets to use because a trinket slot could be wasted if damage rounds up to the same number anyway.

For example, consider a Highwayman base 5-10 weapon, using Grapeshot (0.50). +5% damage and +20% damage have the same result of 4-6.

Either the Embark button or pressing Enter in a textbox starts the calculation.
